These shapefiles are used for 2 purposes:

* Some of them are combined via a Jython script to generate the composite
  routes.zip and stops.zip files, see ../scripts/README.txt

* Some of them (including the generated routes.zip and stops.zip
  files) are hosted for use with tilestream tiles, see the *mml files
  under ../tilemill/

Original sources of these shapefiles listed here:
 https://docs.google.com/a/openplans.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtSxsdtsklRddERnT1lXcDdLNFBZOXdzQVBZLWZKVHc&pli=1#gid=0

Any file with "tweaked" in its name is one we've hand-edited, either
for nicer appearance, or for correcting or adding data requested by
the client, or to make easier to use with tilemill & leaflet.

These shapefiles are used for our tilestream tiles, see the *mml files
under ../tilemill/.

Original sources of these shapefiles listed here:
 https://docs.google.com/a/openplans.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtSxsdtsklRddERnT1lXcDdLNFBZOXdzQVBZLWZKVHc&pli=1#gid=0

Two of them, routes.zip and stops.zip, are combined via a Jython
script from other source files; see ../../scripts/README.txt

Any file with "tweaked" in its name is one we've hand-edited, either
for nicer appearance, or for correcting or adding data requested by
the client, or to make easier to use with tilemill & leaflet.
